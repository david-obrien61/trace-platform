## AI Engine

**What:** Unified multi-provider AI router. Single interface for all AI tasks across all verticals.  
**Status:** ✅ Built — TypeScript  
**Location:** `packages/shared/src/ai/AIEngine.ts`  
**Original source:** `CAI/AIEngine.js` (archive — do not edit)  
**Backend:** `CAI/ai_router.py` (FastAPI, Railway) — **LEGACY for web builds.** AIEngine.call() fails gracefully (`{ ok: false }`) when no backend is reachable. Port to Vercel serverless functions when activating AI features. See Tech Debt #12 in CLAUDE.md.  
**Import:** `import AIEngine from '@trace/shared/ai/AIEngine'`

**13 tasks:**

| Task | Provider | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `vin_decode` | Gemini 2.0 Flash | Photo → vehicle info |
| `invoice_scan` | Gemini 2.0 Flash | Photo → line items |
| `label_read` | Gemini 2.0 Flash | Tool/fluid label → spec |
| `part_photo_id` | Gemini 2.0 Flash | Part photo → ID + compatibility |
| `invoice_audit` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Invoice → uncaptured charges flagged |
| `dtc_decode` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | DTC codes → plain-language diagnosis |
| `estimate_draft` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Job description → draft estimate |
| `compliance_check` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Document → DOT/regulatory flags |
| `customer_summary` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | History array → relationship summary |
| `pmi_suggest` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Equipment data → maintenance schedule |
| `predictive_analysis` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Job history → risk patterns |
| `savings_report` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Shop history → margin recovery report |
| `voice_transcribe` | OpenAI Whisper | Audio → transcript |
| `parts_nlp` | OpenAI GPT-4o | Free-text parts → structured list |
| `intent_classify` | OpenAI GPT-4o | Customer message → intent category |

**Tier gating:**
- TRIAL: all tasks
- STARTER: none (no-AI tier)
- PROFESSIONAL: 12 tasks
- PREMIER: all tasks

`AIEngine.canUse(task, tier)` → boolean. Call before running any task.

**Convenience wrappers:** `decodeVIN`, `decodeDTC`, `transcribeVoice`, `extractParts`, `readToolLabel`, `suggestPMI`, `auditInvoice`, `draftEstimate`, `savingsReport`

**Haiku fallback:** Pass `options.fallback = true` to retry failed Sonnet calls with Haiku.

**Not yet built:** `SavingsReport.jsx` — React display component for `savings_report` output. API is complete; only display work remains.

---

## FastAPI AI Backend (ai_router.py) — LEGACY

**What:** FastAPI router that handles all actual AI provider API calls.  
**Status:** ⚠️ Legacy — built for the React Native mobile app where API keys couldn't live in the bundle. Now that Ignition OS is a Vercel web app, keys live in Vercel env vars and functions handle them server-side. Railway is not needed.  
**Location:** `CAI/ai_router.py` (archive)  
**Forward path:** Port the 11 endpoints to TypeScript Vercel functions under `packages/ignition-os/api/`. Start with `dtc_decode` and `estimate_draft` (text-only, no vision complexity). See Tech Debt #12 in CLAUDE.md.  
**Exception:** `voice_transcribe` sends audio files — Vercel's 4.5MB payload limit needs evaluation before porting.

**Endpoints:**
- Gemini: `POST /ai/vin_decode`, `/ai/invoice_scan`, `/ai/label_read`, `/ai/part_photo_id`
- Claude: `POST /ai/dtc_decode`, `/ai/estimate_draft`, `/ai/pmi_suggest`, `/ai/invoice_audit`, `/ai/savings_report`
- OpenAI: `POST /ai/voice_transcribe`, `/ai/parts_nlp`, `/ai/intent_classify`

**Cost tracking:** `_log_usage()` writes to `ai_usage` table (includes `cost_usd` per call).  
**Error tracking:** `_log_error()` writes to `error_events` table. Non-fatal — calls never block.

---

## Subscription Tiers + Pricing

**Official pricing doc:** `CAI/docs/pricing_sheet.html` (printable, authoritative)

| Tier | Price | Users | AI |
|---|---|---|---|
| STARTER | $149/mo | 3 | None |
| PROFESSIONAL | $299/mo | 8 | AI Bundle (12 tasks) |
| PREMIER | $499/mo | Unlimited | Full AI (13 tasks) |
| Trial | Free, 14 days | Unlimited | Full PREMIER access |

**Add-ons:**
- Extra Location: +$99/mo
- 5-User Block: +$49/mo
- SMS: +$29/mo
- API Access: +$99/mo

**Module matrix (PROFESSIONAL tier includes):**
VIN Decode, Scribe AI, DTC Cipher, Parts & Manifest, Procurement, Stock AI, CRM, OMNI Summary

**PREMIER adds:**
Full OMNI, HUB Dispatch, DOT Compliance, Tools+PMI, Predictive Maintenance, Multi-Location, White-Label Portal

**Trial:** 14 days full PREMIER, no card required, hardware kit included.

---

## AdminSubscription / Marketplace UI

**What:** Owner-facing module marketplace. Shows all modules, trial status, pricing. Admin can start trials, see days remaining, configure umbrella subscription price.  
**Status:** ✅ Built (JSX, Ignition OS only — not yet in shared or Cultivar)  
**Location:** `packages/ignition-os/modules/AdminSubscription.jsx`  
**Default umbrella price:** $299/mo (state variable, admin-adjustable in UI)

**Module keys and display names:**
- `FLUX` → Workflow
- `PREDICTIVE` → Predict
- `ESTIMATOR` → Estimator
- `CODE` → DTC Cipher
- `STOK` → Inventory
- `PROT` → Margins
- `HUB` → Dispatch
- `PROC` → Vendors

**Per-module state shape:**
```js
{ active: boolean, tier: 'NONE'|'BASIC'|'PRO', trialActive: boolean, trialStartedAt: ISOString|null }
```

**startTrial():** Sets `active=true`, `tier='PRO'`, `trialActive=true`, `trialStartedAt=now`  
**calculateDaysLeft():** `Math.max(0, 30 - daysSinceStart)` — 30-day module trial window

---

## Trial Clock

**Two distinct trial concepts:**

1. **Platform trial (14-day):** Full PREMIER access. Set in `OnboardingWizard.finalize()`. Stored in Supabase `shops` table as `trial_started_at` / `trial_ends_at`. After expiry: data blur on all modules.

2. **Per-module trial (30-day):** Each module independently. `calculateDaysLeft()` in `AdminSubscription.jsx`. Stored in `DataBridge` as `modules[MODULE_ID].trialStartedAt`.

**Data blur on expiry:** `filter blur-md pointer-events-none opacity-30` wrapper around module content. Ignition only. Not yet extracted to shared or used in Cultivar.

**Shared type:** `SubscriptionTier` in `packages/shared/src/supabase/types.ts` has `trial_started_at` field — the seam where this plugs in.

---

## DataBridge

**What:** localStorage-first data layer for Ignition OS. Single key `IGNITION_OS_DATA` stores all shop state: profiles, jobs, modules, trial clocks, integrations.  
**Status:** ✅ Built (JavaScript, Ignition OS only — intentionally not shared)  
**Location:** `packages/ignition-os/DataBridge.js`

**Key methods:**
- `DataBridge.save(key, value)` — persist to localStorage
- `DataBridge.getProfiles()` — list of shop user profiles
- `DataBridge.checkTrialStatus(moduleId)` — returns `{ isExpired }`
- `DataBridge.get('shop_info')` — shop name, phone, USDOT, etc.
- `DataBridge.get('shop_policy')` — active modules, margin rules, tier

**Important:** `STORAGE_KEY = 'IGNITION_OS_DATA'` is hardcoded in `packages/shared/src/quickbooks/oauth.ts`. This is Tech Debt #2 in CLAUDE.md — OFF LIMITS until post-demo fix.

---

## Tile System

**What:** 3-state tile grid for module navigation. States: active (works), available (can enable), locked (upgrade required). Supports count badge for notifications.  
**Status:** ✅ Built and live — TypeScript/React  
**Location:** `packages/shared/src/components/tiles/TileGrid.tsx` + `Tile.tsx`  
**Used by:** Cultivar OS Dashboard.tsx, Ignition OS AdminSubscription.jsx

**Tile states:**
- `active` — module is enabled and configured. Green dot. onClick routes to module (currently a stub).
- `available` — module can be enabled. Shows "Enable" button. onClick triggers setup flow.
- `locked` — requires tier upgrade. `onClick={undefined}`. LockedOverlay visible.

**Count badge:** `count` prop on Tile. Amber badge top-left. Used by Social Media tile to show pending draft count.

---

## configureAuth Factory

**What:** Vertical-agnostic auth factory. Returns `useSession` hook + `PrivateRoute` + `AuthProvider` configured for either email/password (Cultivar) or PIN/localStorage (Ignition).  
**Status:** ✅ Built — TypeScript  
**Location:** `packages/shared/src/auth/configureAuth.tsx`

**Email strategy (Cultivar OS):** Supabase email/password. `auth.uid()` is non-null. Required for RLS to work.  
**PIN strategy (Ignition OS):** localStorage-first. `auth.uid()` is always null. **Do not use in any multi-tenant context.**

---

## Multi-Tenant Auth System (Shared)

**What:** Full invite-based team management for any vertical. Owner invites members by email; member receives a `/join?token=...` link, creates a Supabase account, and is linked to the owner's business.  
**Status:** ✅ Built — TypeScript (branch: multi-tenant-extraction — not yet merged to main as of 2026-06-02)  
**Location:** `packages/shared/src/auth/`

**Schema (cultivar-os Supabase project — bgobkjcopcxusjsetfob):**
- `business_members` — links `auth.uid()` to a `businesses.id`. Columns: `role`, `permissions` (text[]), `active`, `pin_hash` (added 2026-06-03). RLS: owner full access, member reads own row.
- `invitations` — pending invite tokens. 7-day expiry. `used` flag prevents replay. RLS: owner full access.
- `member_devices` — optional device tracking (denormalized `business_id` for RLS without join).
- **Migration pending (David):** `supabase/migrations/20260603_business_members_add_pin_hash.sql` adds `pin_hash` to business_members in bgobkjcopcxusjsetfob.

**Shared TypeScript modules:**
- `auth/types.ts` — `Member`, `Invitation`, `Role`, `VerticalAdapter`, `AcceptInviteResult`, `InvitePreview`
- `auth/members.ts` — `getMembersByBusiness`, `updateMemberRole`, `removeMember`, `checkPermission`
- `auth/invitations.ts` — `createInvitation`, `revokeInvitation`, `getPendingInvitations`, `expireInvitations`
- `auth/acceptInvitation.ts` — `previewInvitation`, `acceptInvitation` (service-key server functions)
- `auth/AcceptInvite.tsx` — React accept-invite page component (inline styles, TRACE green)
- `auth/OwnerSignup.tsx` — Multi-step signup with PIN: Owner Info → PIN Setup → Biometric (optional) → vertical steps. Config-driven. Added 2026-06-03.
- `auth/index.ts` — barrel export
- `supabase/auth.ts` — `authenticateMember(businessId, pin)` for platform-wide business_members PIN auth (added 2026-06-03). Also: `getMemberSession()`, `clearMemberSession()`.

**Cultivar OS integration:**
- `api/members/preview-invite.ts` — Vercel GET handler (reads token, returns business name + role)
- `api/members/accept-invite.ts` — Vercel POST handler (activates member row, marks invitation used)
- `src/pages/Settings.tsx` TeamSection — invite form, member list, pending invitations, copy-link UI
- `src/router.tsx` — public `/join` route → `AcceptInvite` component
- `src/auth/roles.ts` — OWNER / MANAGER / STAFF role definitions with permission arrays

**Permission model:**
- `null` permissions = owner (full access implied)
- `string[]` permissions = member's explicit permission list from the DB column
- Gate expression: `const canX = isOwner || (userPermissions ?? []).includes('permission_key')`
- MANAGER excludes `manage_settings` by design — cannot reach Settings page

**Test coverage:** `scripts/test-member-login.mjs` — 8 sections, 29 assertions against live DB. Verified: owner path, member path, MANAGER permission exclusions, LAWNS-specific invite flow.

---

## BusinessProvider (Shared Context)

**What:** React context that resolves the logged-in user's business and exposes it across the app. Two-path resolution: owner fast-path, member fallback.  
**Status:** ✅ Built — TypeScript  
**Location:** `packages/shared/src/context/BusinessProvider.tsx`  
**Exports:** `BusinessProvider`, `useBusinessContext`, `Business`, `BusinessContextValue` (from `packages/shared/src/context/index.ts`)

**Resolution logic:**
1. Owner path (fast): `businesses WHERE owner_id = auth.uid() AND business_type = $type`
2. Member fallback (if owner returns null): `business_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND active = true` with `businesses(*)` PostgREST join

**Context values:**
- `business: Business | null` — full businesses row
- `businessId: string | null`
- `businessError: string | null` — `'no_business'` when neither path resolves
- `loading: boolean`
- `reload: () => void`
- `userPermissions: string[] | null` — null = owner, string[] = member's DB-stored permissions
- `isOwner: boolean`

**Consumed by:** `packages/cultivar-os/src/App.tsx` (`<BusinessProvider businessType="nursery">`), all Cultivar pages via `useBusinessContext()`.

**Note:** Member-path does not filter by `business_type` — that filter is an owner-side concept. Members join a business directly. If a user is a member of multiple businesses, `.single()` will fail. Acceptable for v1.

---

## QB Token Refresh

**What:** Proactive QuickBooks token refresh. Checks expiry before any invoice call. Refreshes if missing or within 10 min of expiry. Sets `qb_needs_reconnect=true` and returns null if refresh token is dead.  
**Status:** ✅ Built — TypeScript  
**Location:** `packages/shared/src/quickbooks/refresh.ts`  
**Used by:** `packages/cultivar-os/api/qbo/invoice/cultivar.ts`

---

## Notification System

**What:** Provider-agnostic notification sender + queue. Supports Resend (email) and Twilio (SMS).  
**Status:** 🟡 Built but unconfirmed active — env vars not verified  
**Location:** `packages/shared/src/notifications/send.ts` + `queue.ts`

**Templates (Cultivar OS):** `packages/shared/src/notifications/templates/cultivar.ts`
- `order_confirmation` — sends after checkout (only one actively wired)
- `netting_waiver_reminder` — template exists, not scheduled
- `care_tips_30d` — template exists, not scheduled
- `seasonal_offer` — template exists, not scheduled
- `delivery_scheduled` — template exists, not wired

**sendSilently():** Fire-and-forget. Used in `useSubmitOrder.ts`. Never blocks order flow.

---

## Social Media Module (Cultivar OS)

**What:** Full Blotato-connected social post pipeline. Generates 3 AI posts per order, queues as drafts, owner reviews and publishes from dashboard.  
**Status:** ✅ Built and live (Cultivar OS only)  
**Backend:**
- `api/social/generate-posts.ts` — Claude Sonnet 4.6, 3 post types per order
- `api/social/enable.ts` — upserts nursery_modules enabled+configured
- `api/social/publish.ts` — POSTs to Blotato v2 API

**Post types:** educational, customer_story, seasonal  
**Status lifecycle:** draft → published | failed  
**Blotato endpoint:** `POST https://backend.blotato.com/v2/posts`  
**Prompt caching:** System prompt uses `cache_control: ephemeral` for cost reduction

---

## QR Checkout Flow (Cultivar OS)

**What:** Complete scan-to-invoice flow. QR scan → plant profile → add-ons → customer capture → cart review → order submit → QB invoice → email confirmation.  
**Status:** ✅ Built and live — end-to-end  
**Route:** `/plant/:sku` → `/plant/:sku/addons` → `/checkout/customer` → `/checkout/review` → `/checkout/confirm`

**Key files:**
- `PlantProfile.tsx` — plant detail, add to cart
- `AddOns.tsx` — transport toggle (self/delivery/install), netting prompt, addon checkboxes
- `CustomerCapture.tsx` — name, phone, email
- `CartReview.tsx` — order summary, submit
- `Confirmation.tsx` — invoice link, scan another
- `api/orders/submit.ts` — writes order + order_items + order_addons, customer dedup by email
- `api/qbo/invoice/cultivar.ts` — creates QB invoice + customer

**Install price:** Captured from `plants.install_price`. QB line item created. Scheduling not built.  
**Leakage flag:** Set in `api/orders/submit.ts` when add-ons declined and transport is self-only.

---

## OwnerSignup (Shared)

**What:** Multi-step shared owner signup component with PIN gesture layer. Step 1: Owner Info (business name, owner name, email, password, phone, address, website). Step 2: PIN setup. Step 3: Biometric registration (optional, skippable). Optional vertical steps array.  
**Status:** ✅ Built 2026-06-03 — shared, consumed by both Cultivar and Ignition  
**Location:** `packages/shared/src/auth/OwnerSignup.tsx`

**Config-driven:** Each vertical provides an `OwnerSignupConfig` specifying `memberTable`, `memberFKColumn`, `ownerRole`, `ownerPermissions`, `pinLength`, and an `onSuccess` callback. The vertical's `onSuccess` handles post-signup vertical-specific setup (e.g., Ignition creates the matching `shops` row and seeds DataBridge).

**PIN hash:** SHA-256 of `{businessId}:{pin}` — consistent with `hashPin()` in `packages/shared/src/supabase/auth.ts`.

**Retry-aware:** If "User already registered" → attempts signIn → if no businesses row → continues business creation. Handles orphaned auth users from partial prior signups.

---

## OnboardingWizard (Ignition OS)

**What:** 3-step flow wrapping shared OwnerSignup. Welcome screen (dark Ignition theme) → OwnerSignup (TRACE green theme, full account + PIN setup) → Done screen (dark Ignition theme).  
**Status:** ✅ Updated 2026-06-03 — uses shared OwnerSignup  
**Location:** `packages/ignition-os/modules/OnboardingWizard.jsx`

**onSuccess callback:** Creates matching `shops` row (same UUID as `businesses.id`) in ufsgqckbxdtwviqjjtos, seeds DataBridge with shopId + shopName + current_user session, marks onboarding_complete=true.

**Migration required:** `packages/ignition-os/supabase/migrations/20260603_recreate_shop_members.sql` must be applied to ufsgqckbxdtwviqjjtos before new Ignition signups work.

**Extraction target:** `packages/shared/src/onboarding/WizardShell.tsx` (see TRACE_PLATFORM_AUDIT.md Top 10 #1) — post-August

---

## OnboardingWizard (Cultivar OS)

**What:** 4-path first-run experience for new nursery owners who arrived via email invite or direct login (not via /signup). Welcome → NurserySetup → ChoosePath → PathExperience → Done. Proves value immediately.  
**Status:** ✅ Built (Cultivar OS only)  
**Location:** `packages/cultivar-os/src/pages/OnboardingWizard.tsx`  
**Route:** `/onboarding` (public, redirected from Dashboard when business row is missing AND user came from login rather than /signup)

**4 paths:**
- LEAKAGE — leakage calculator: shows annual missed add-on revenue
- CHECKOUT — 4-slide visual walkthrough of the QR checkout flow
- SETUP — QuickBooks integration teaser
- DELIVERY — demo delivery stops → Google Maps route → SMS driver link

**Note:** New owner signup now goes through `/signup` (shared OwnerSignup) which creates the businesses row and OWNER member row as part of signup. The OnboardingWizard is triggered only when a user has a Supabase session but no businesses row (e.g., edge cases from prior incomplete signups before June 3).

---

## Settings Page (Cultivar OS)

**What:** Owner-facing settings. Business profile, accounting (QB connect/disconnect), sales prompts (netting, install price), and team management.  
**Status:** ✅ Built — TypeScript  
**Location:** `packages/cultivar-os/src/pages/Settings.tsx`  
**Route:** `/settings` (private; members without `manage_settings` are auto-redirected to `/dashboard`)

**Sections:**
- **NurserySection** — nursery name, phone, address, email, website, tax rate. Reads from `businesses` table.
- **AccountingSection** — QuickBooks connect/disconnect button. Shows connection status.
- **SalesPromptsSection** — default install price (`nursery_profiles.default_install_price`), netting prompt toggle.
- **TeamSection** — active member list, pending invitations, invite form (name/email/role), invite link copy button.

**Permission gate:** `canManageSettings = isOwner || userPermissions.includes('manage_settings')`. MANAGER role does not include `manage_settings` by design.

---

## Orders Page (Cultivar OS)

**What:** Last 50 orders with leakage highlighting. Shows transport icon, customer name, amount, leakage flag.  
**Status:** ✅ Built — TypeScript  
**Location:** `packages/cultivar-os/src/pages/Orders.tsx`  
**Route:** `/orders` (private)

**Features:** Green border = no leakage, red border = leakage flagged. Transport icons: 🚗 self / 🚚 delivery / 🌿 install. Queries `orders` joined with `customers`.

---

## Delivery Routing (Cultivar OS)

**What:** Generate a multi-stop delivery route from pending delivery orders. Checkbox selection per stop, inline address override for missing addresses, numbered stops list, Google Maps URL, SMS-to-driver.  
**Status:** ✅ Built — TypeScript  
**Location:** `packages/cultivar-os/src/pages/DeliveryRoute.tsx`  
**Route:** `/deliveries` (private)

**Actions:** Open in Google Maps (multi-stop URL), Text to Driver (native SMS with route link), Copy Route Link.

**Capability gap:** Delivery addresses use `customer.address_line1`. If a customer didn't provide an address at checkout, the page shows an inline override field (local state only — not persisted). Persisted delivery addresses require a `delivery_address` column on `orders` and capture at checkout for `transport_method = 'delivery'`. Migration not yet written.

**Capability gap:** No `delivery_date` on orders. Route shows all pending delivery orders with no scheduled date filtering.

---

## Campaign Scheduler (Cultivar OS)

**What:** Schedule, generate, and track social media campaigns. AI-generated post drafts with tone learning from published posts.  
**Status:** ✅ Built — TypeScript (Cultivar OS only)  
**Location:** `packages/cultivar-os/src/pages/Campaigns.tsx` + `CampaignDetail.tsx`  
**Route:** `/campaigns` + `/campaigns/:id` (private)

**Backend:**
- `packages/cultivar-os/api/campaigns/generate.ts` — Claude Sonnet 4.6, generates posts using tone samples as few-shot examples
- `packages/cultivar-os/api/campaigns/publish-post.ts` — marks published, auto-saves (original, edited) pairs as tone samples for future generation

**Schema:** `campaigns`, `campaign_posts`, `campaign_tone_samples` tables + RLS + LAWNS seed data. Migration: `supabase/migrations/20260529_campaigns.sql`.

**Dashboard integration:** "Campaign Scheduler" card shows green border when drafts are pending.

---

## CoolRunnings

**What:** Separate vertical for homes. Not part of trace-platform monorepo.  
**Status:** Active development, separate repo  
**Repo:** `david-obrien61/CoolRunning` on GitHub  
**Desktop folder:** `~/Desktop/CoolRunning/`  
**Assessment tool:** `~/Desktop/trace-assessment-app/` — standalone, no git

---

## Repo Map (Desktop → GitHub)

| Desktop Folder | GitHub Repo | What's in it | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `~/Desktop/trace-platform/` | `david-obrien61/trace-platform` | Cultivar OS (active) · ignition-os (active — web build complete 2026-05-28) | Active — primary monorepo. Only folder that deploys to Vercel. Both verticals deploy from here. |
| `~/Desktop/CAI/` | `david-obrien61/CAI` | Ignition OS (original JavaScript source) | **Archive (2026-05-28)** — web build migrated to `packages/ignition-os/`. Read-only. Keep for `ai_router.py` reference until Railway is decommissioned. |
| `~/Desktop/CoolRunning/` | `david-obrien61/CoolRunning` | CoolRunnings vertical | Active — separate vertical. |
| `~/Desktop/IgnitionMobile/` | `david-obrien61/ignition` (archived) | Ignition OS mobile prototype | Archive — rename folder to `IgnitionMobile-archive`. |
| `~/Desktop/Cultivar-os/` | (none) | Empty | Safe to delete. |
| `~/Desktop/trace-assessment-app/` | (none) | CoolRunnings assessment tool | Standalone, no git. |

## What Is NOT Yet Built (High-Priority Gaps)

| Capability | Who needs it | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SavingsReport.jsx | Ignition OS | React display component for `savings_report` task. API complete. Display work only. (Tech Debt #10) |
| Stripe billing | All verticals | Types exist in shared. No Stripe calls anywhere. localStorage placeholder in Ignition. |
| Customer directory | Cultivar OS | `customers` table exists, no browse/search UI. Lauren needs this. |
| Online Shop | Cultivar OS | Tile exists, "Enable" stub. Next roadmap item. |
| Follow-Up engine | Cultivar OS | Tile exists, nothing built. |
| Abstract asset model | Shared | QR→record→event pattern is identical in both verticals. Extract before Conduit OS. |
| Onboarding wizard (shared) | Shared | Two separate OnboardingWizard implementations (Ignition + Cultivar). Extract WizardShell to shared before Conduit OS. |
| Trial clock enforcement | Cultivar OS | Seam exists in useModules.ts line 100 (`nurseryPlan = 'starter'`). No blur, no Stripe. |
| Delivery address persistence | Cultivar OS | DeliveryRoute.tsx shows inline address override but does not persist it. Needs `delivery_address` column on `orders` and capture at checkout for delivery transport. |
| Delivery date scheduling | Cultivar OS | No `delivery_date` on orders. Route shows all pending with no date filtering. |
| Per-plant install price edit | Cultivar OS | `plants.install_price` read-only in UI. No edit surface. Post-demo. |
| Tighten nursery_modules RLS | Cultivar OS | `authenticated_select_nursery_modules` allows any authenticated user to read any nursery's modules. Must restrict to owner_id join post-demo. (CLAUDE.md post-demo task) |
| Port ai_router.py to Vercel functions | Ignition OS | Railway is legacy for web build. Port 11 endpoints to `packages/ignition-os/api/`. (Tech Debt #12) |

## ✅ Resolved Gaps (previously listed as Not Yet Built)

| Capability | Resolved | How |
|---|---|---|
| Signup → nursery row creation | 2026-05-29 | OnboardingWizard (Cultivar OS) creates `businesses` + `nursery_profiles` rows on finalize(). New accounts redirect to /onboarding. |
| Settings page (Cultivar OS) | 2026-05-29 + 2026-06-02 | Settings.tsx built with NurserySection, AccountingSection, SalesPromptsSection, TeamSection. Permission gate added 2026-06-02. |
| Delivery routing (Cultivar OS) | 2026-05-29 | DeliveryRoute.tsx at /deliveries. Multi-stop Google Maps URL, SMS-to-driver. |
| Multi-tenant member login | 2026-06-02 | BusinessProvider two-path resolution. Members land on Dashboard, not "Account not linked" wall. |
