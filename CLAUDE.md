# CLAUDE.md — TRACE Platform
# Multi-AI Handoff Workflow — Claude Code reads this every session
# Last updated: 2026-06-13 (THUNDER VERIFY-GATE: schema verification gate added to end-of-session-protocol.md + CLAUDE.md §9; 4-table catalog-backed verification run against business_assets/business_inventory/business_pmi_schedule/business_service_log)
# Current AI: Claude Code

## CONTEXT BUDGET CHECK — run THIS FIRST, before reading anything else

1. **CLAUDE.md size:** If this file exceeds ~600 lines, FLAG to David before proceeding:
   > "CLAUDE.md is [N] lines — it may be filling context on load. Recommend trimming
   > handoff history to docs/handoff-archive.md before we proceed."
   Do NOT silently push on.
2. **Working files:** Before opening any file to read or edit, note its line count first.
   If >~600 lines, read in chunks (`offset`/`limit`) — never load a large file whole.
   Flag files >~800 lines per the file-size rule in §9.
3. **Build logs / install output:** Never dump full output into context. Use targeted reads
   and summarized output only.
4. **Repeated auto-compaction:** If you notice it happening, STOP and tell David which
   file or output is oversized rather than pushing through — thrashing wastes the session.

Context is finite space, not compute. Read narrowly; flag early.

---

## SESSION HEALTH CHECK — run at session open, before any code or docs

```bash
date                          # 1. Verify today's date — update memory/currentDate if stale
git branch --show-current     # 2. Confirm branch (main or feature branch as appropriate)
ls PLATFORM_STATE.md          # 3. Must exist at repo root — if missing, stop and tell David
git status --short            # 4. Flag any ?? untracked files before starting work
head -4 docs/built-inventory.md  # 5. Check 'Last updated:' — if older than latest capability commit, FLAG as stale
head -2 docs/inventory-functions.md docs/inventory-env.md docs/inventory-ai.md  # 6. Check inventory doc dates — FLAG stale if older than latest commit touching their domain
```

**Rules:**
- **Date ≠ memory/currentDate** → update `~/.claude/projects/-Users-terrenceobrien-Desktop-trace-platform/memory/` before proceeding — stale dates corrupt commit messages and handoff entries.
- **PLATFORM_STATE.md missing** → do NOT write any code; report to David before proceeding.
- **`??` files in git status** → report them to David; sort before starting code work.
- **Reread ⛔ LAUNCH GATES** in PLATFORM_STATE.md every session — never cross a gate without David's explicit direction.
- **`built-inventory.md` Last updated older than latest capability commit** → FLAG as stale before using it to answer "was X built?" — re-audit is the cost of a stale index.
- **Inventory docs stale** → any of `docs/inventory-functions.md`, `docs/inventory-env.md`, `docs/inventory-ai.md` older than the latest commit touching its domain → FLAG before answering questions from it.

> CRITICAL: Read this entire file before touching any code.
> Update the Handoff section (Part 3) before ending every session.
> Update GEMINI.md with the same changes if Gemini is in use.

## Scope & Hierarchy

This document owns session-by-session handoff state, current infrastructure specifics, and the active task list. Read this first at the start of every Claude Code session.

When this doc conflicts with another:
- For verified current state of every platform item (LEVEL + LOCATION + EVIDENCE), see PLATFORM_STATE.md — read this first every session before writing any code
- For strategy, demo plan, or revenue questions, see MASTER_BRIEF.md
- For architecture or where things should live, see PLATFORM_STRATEGY.md
- For what's actually built in code, see PLATFORM_AUDIT.md
- For the discovery module, see DISCOVERY_MODULE_BRIEF.md (created Session 1b)
- For engineering standards (STD-001 through STD-010 + BENCH-A, BENCH-C, BENCH-D), see STANDARDS.md
- For reuse ratio figures, see PLATFORM_AUDIT.md "Reuse ratio — corrected ground truth (2026-05-28)"; the 68/78/80% figures cited in prior sessions are retired.

Update the handoff section at the end of every session.

## 1. CORE MANDATE

You are building the TRACE platform — a composable AI operating
system for owner-operated small businesses. One codebase. One
deployment. Infinite verticals. Each vertical is a configured
instance of the same shared platform.

**CRITICAL RULES — NON-NEGOTIABLE:**

1. Before writing ANY new module, check packages/shared/src/ first
2. If it exists in shared → import and configure. Never rebuild.
3. If it needs to be shared → build it IN shared/ first, then import
4. Never hardcode a vertical name inside a shared module
5. Never duplicate auth, QB, QR, notifications, or UI primitives
6. packages/ignition-os is now an active build target — treat it like cultivar-os
7. Never end a session without updating this Handoff section
8. Commit after every completed task

---

## 1.5. ARCHITECTURE CONSTANTS (Enforcement Hook)

Full text lives ONLY in PLATFORM_STRATEGY.md § Architecture Constants. Check it before any schema, RLS, route, or shared-identifier change. One-line summaries for quick reference:

- **AC-1:** No vertical nouns in shared schema/code. Vertical identity is a value (`business_type`), never a table name, column, or identifier.
- **AC-2:** RLS scoped to `business_id` membership by default. Looser policy requires WHY + Exception Log entry in PLATFORM_STRATEGY.md.
- **AC-3:** Tenant isolation absolute — cross-vertical resolution returns no-access, never a wrong-vertical record.
- **AC-4:** Structural design shared; only tokens (color) and vocabulary vary per vertical.
- **AC-5:** One integration = one connector = one router. Cross-integration routers forbidden (Alan Effect). Consolidate-when-touched for existing violations; log accepted deviations in `decisions/override-log.md`.

**Known open violations (audit 2026-06-04 — tracked in Active Tasks §Noun Purge):**
- AC-1: ~~`nursery_modules`~~ ✅ resolved 2026-06-04 · `nursery_profiles` table name · `nurseryName` in `qr/print.ts` · `shopId`/`shop_id` in `AIEngine.ts`
- AC-2: Some RLS policies are `USING(true)` — documented intentional, post-demo tighten
- AC-4: Cultivar green `#27500A` default in shared UI primitives (post-August 2026)
See `docs/audits/platform-naming-vertical-leak-audit-2026-06-03.md` for full inventory.

## 2. STATUS & ARCHITECTURE

### Key Contacts

**LAWNS Tree Farm (Leander, TX)** — Cultivar OS prospect, prototype demo customer
- Terry: owner, 65, retiring soon, tech-shy, approval gatekeeper
- Lauren Bishop: manager, the real operational buyer, the champion who feels the pain
- "Layna" was a miscommunication and is not a real contact. Do not reintroduce.

**Operation Liberty Hill (Liberty Hill, TX)** — KINNA-OS anchor pilot customer
- Regina O'Brien: Program Director, anchor pilot user. Holds active job offer; planning graceful exit. David's wife.
- Hard target: Back to School distribution, Saturday August 1, 2026

- **Current phase:** Phase 0 — Cultivar OS demo prep
- **Demo meeting:** Next week — LAWNS Tree Farm LLC, Leander TX
- **Key contacts:** Terry (owner), Lauren (manager)
- **Active vertical:** cultivar-os
- **Tech stack:** React + Vite + TypeScript · Supabase · Vercel
- **Source of truth:** Supabase PostgreSQL (NEW project)
- **Repo:** github.com/david-obrien61/trace-platform (private)
- **Frontend deploy:** Vercel → cultivar-os.vercel.app
- **Backend:** Vercel serverless functions (api/ at repo root)
- **Railway:** Ignition OS only — do NOT use for cultivar-os

### Supabase Projects — TWO SEPARATE PROJECTS

```
cultivar-os (NEW — active):
  Project ref: bgobkjcopcxusjsetfob
  URL: https://bgobkjcopcxusjsetfob.supabase.co
  Tables: ⚠️ This list is a quick-reference only — it is stale.
          Canonical per-table state (LEVEL + LOCATION + EVIDENCE): PLATFORM_STATE.md.
          Confirmed tables (2026-06-13 audit + THUNDER UNTANGLE):
          nurseries, cultivar_plants, plant_events, orders,
          order_items, order_addons, addons, losses,
          customers, social_drafts, modules,
          business_modules, receipts,
          business_assets, business_inventory,
          business_pmi_schedule, business_service_log,
          businesses, business_members, platform_config
          ⚠️ Diffs vs prior list: businesses/business_members/platform_config were MISSING.
          nursery_modules still EXISTS (pending DROP — see PLATFORM_STATE.md IN-FLIGHT).
  Auth: email/password, email confirmation OFF
  ⚠️ WHY OFF: outbound mail not working (Supabase default SMTP rate-limited /
     unreliable — verification emails were not being delivered). Confirmation
     was disabled pre-2026-06-11 (exact date unknown) so that signup works
     while mail is broken. Account creation currently works ONLY because
     confirmation is off.
  ⚠️ LAUNCH GATE: fix SMTP (Resend/SendGrid/Postmark) → then re-enable
     confirmation. These are COUPLED — turning confirmation on with broken
     mail means signup can't complete. Mail FIRST, then confirmation.
     Tied to same trigger as abuse guards: first paying customer / public
     self-serve. See PLATFORM_STATE.md LAUNCH GATES.

ignition-os (OLD — do not touch):

### Registered Domains (as of 2026-05-26)

All domains registered at GoDaddy under David's account.

| Domain | Protection | Status / Use |
|---|---|---|
| trace-enterprises.com | None | Parent company domain |
| builtwithcai.com | Full Protection | Methodology brand; hosts discovery.builtwithcai.com (planned subdomain) |
| cultivar-os.com | None | Cultivar OS (nursery vertical) — currently forwards to cultivar-os.app |
| cultivar-os.app | None | Cultivar OS production app (live) |
| ignition-os.com | Full Protection | Ignition OS (diesel/auto vertical) |
| ignition-os.app | None | Ignition OS (alternate TLD) |
| conduit-os.com | None | Conduit OS (HVAC/electrical vertical) |
| conduit-os.app | None | Conduit OS (alternate TLD) |
| kinna-os.com | None | KINNA-OS (faith-based and direct-service nonprofit vertical) |
| kinna-os.app | None | KINNA-OS (alternate TLD) |

**WHOIS privacy status:** Domains marked "None" do NOT have WHOIS privacy enabled, meaning David's registration address is publicly queryable. Plan: defer privacy upgrades to the Cloudflare transfer window opening July 1-2, 2026, which provides free WHOIS privacy as a benefit of the transfer. Current annual cost of GoDaddy WHOIS privacy across the unprotected domains would be approximately $13/yr each.

**Open: which domain hosts the KINNA-OS production app when Phase 1 ships.** Options include kinna-os.app (matches Cultivar's pattern), kinna-os.com (matches Ignition's pattern), or a subdomain of builtwithcai.com (matches the discovery surface pattern). Decision deferred to pre-build.

---

### Desktop Folder → GitHub Repo Map (verified 2026-05-28)

> Before starting any build session, confirm which desktop folder maps to the target vertical.
> Do not edit a folder that is not linked to the active GitHub repo.

| Desktop Folder | GitHub Repo | Deployed Vertical | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `~/Desktop/trace-platform/` | `david-obrien61/trace-platform` | Cultivar OS (active) · ignition-os (planned) | **Active — primary monorepo** |
| `~/Desktop/CAI/` | `david-obrien61/CAI` | Ignition OS (original) | **Archive (2026-05-28)** — Ignition OS web build is now live in `trace-platform/packages/ignition-os/`. CAI/ is read-only. Keep for `ai_router.py` reference only until Railway is decommissioned. |
| `~/Desktop/CoolRunning/` | `david-obrien61/CoolRunning` | CoolRunnings (home automation) | Active — separate vertical, separate repo |
| `~/Desktop/IgnitionMobile/` | `david-obrien61/ignition` *(archived)* | Ignition OS mobile prototype | **Archive** — GitHub repo is archived. Rename desktop folder to `IgnitionMobile-archive`. Keep for migration reference until ignition-os web build is complete. |
| `~/Desktop/Cultivar-os/` | *(none — no git)* | — | **Empty folder** — safe to delete. Real Cultivar OS is in `trace-platform/packages/cultivar-os/`. |
| `~/Desktop/trace-assessment-app/` | *(none — no git)* | CoolRunnings assessment tool | Standalone app, no git. Contains `src/lib/AIEngine.js` (Claude Vision, device identification — different from Ignition AIEngine). |
| `~/Desktop/CoolRunning/` | `david-obrien61/CoolRunning` | CoolRunnings | See above. |

**Rule:** `trace-platform/` is the only folder that deploys to Vercel. All Cultivar OS work goes here. All Ignition OS work goes here — migration is complete as of 2026-05-28. CAI/ is archive.

---

### Auth Architecture — Locked Rule (2026-05-28)

**Auth: PIN/face are unlock gestures layered on top of a real Supabase session (`auth.uid()` must be non-null) — never a replacement. Tenant isolation and RLS depend on this. Do not introduce PIN-only auth for any vertical handling multi-tenant customer data.**

Context: Cultivar OS uses email/password → Supabase Auth → `auth.uid()` → `nurseries.owner_id` lookup (via `NurseryProvider`). The Ignition OS PIN model is explicitly local-first and intentionally bypasses Supabase Auth — it is a separate, known exception for that vertical's single-device use case, not a pattern to reuse in multi-tenant contexts.

---

## Open Architecture Decisions

Decisions that have been deferred but must be resolved before specific build milestones. Update this list when decisions are made or new ones are deferred.

| # | Decision | Deferred From | Resolve Before | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Surface Honesty" principle name | 2026-05-26 (Session 1b) | 60 days of use, then review | Substance is locked; only the name is provisional |
| 2 | "Honest Friction" principle name | 2026-05-26 (Session 1b) | 60 days of use, then review | Substance is locked; only the name is provisional |
| 3 | KINNA-OS production app domain | 2026-05-26 | KINNA-OS Phase 1 build | Options: kinna-os.app, kinna-os.com, subdomain of builtwithcai.com |
| 5 | PLATFORM_STRATEGY.md file metadata claiming to be authoritative | 2026-05-26 (Session 1a noticed-but-not-touched) | Next PLATFORM_STRATEGY edit pass | Mildly inconsistent with the new Scope & Hierarchy preamble; soften or remove |
| 6 | PANTRY_OS.md file rename (if file is re-created) | 2026-05-26 | If/when a Pantry OS-named file is re-created in the repo | File was not found in the repo at Session 1a, but the question of its potential return is logged |
| 7 | "Honest Velocity" principle name | 2026-05-27 (Brand framing session) | 60 days of use, then review | Substance is locked; only the name is provisional. Joins Surface Honesty and Honest Friction as a coherent family of design principles. |
| 8 | "Epistemic Humility" principle name | 2026-05-27 (Brand framing session) | 60 days of use, then review | Substance is locked; only the name is provisional. Fourth design principle. |
| 9 | Family-member role descriptions in canonical docs | 2026-05-27 (Brand framing session) | Before any public-facing copy uses them | Andrew, Connor, Erin, Regina each get to review and edit their own paragraph in the TRACE — Who We Are block. David sends each their section. |
| 10 | Surface Honesty principle scope — does it cover data values, not just UI elements? | 2026-05-27 (Session K audit findings + nurseries row placeholder data discovery) | Within 30 days of use of the principle | Tonight's work revealed the data layer was lying (fake "Layna" email, 555-prefix fake phone, wrong address) while the UI hardcoded over it with correct values. The principle as committed addresses UI surfaces; the actual failure mode crossed layers. Likely outcome: extend the principle wording in PLATFORM_STRATEGY.md to explicitly cover all data values the system displays, not only UI elements. |
| 11 | Missing-SELECT-RLS-policy pattern — needs systemic prevention | 2026-05-27 (third occurrence of the same root cause: modules May 22, nursery_modules May 22, orders May 27) | Within 30 days OR before any new table is added to Cultivar OS | Three separate instances of the same bug indicate a process gap. Options: (a) Add a checklist item to migration templates requiring a SELECT policy. (b) Build a Claude Code audit that scans schema for tables-without-SELECT-policies and reports them. (c) Add to the standards seed list as STD-NNN "Every table needs RLS policies." Likely outcome: a combination — the standard plus the audit. Worth a focused session post-LAWNS. |
| 12 | "Honest Debt" principle name | 2026-05-28 | 60 days of use, then review | Substance is locked; only the name is provisional. Fifth design principle in PLATFORM_STRATEGY.md. |

## Shared Extraction Roadmap

Audit completed 2026-05-29. Full findings live in session context. Canonical priority order:

**Immediate (LOW complexity, do next available session):**
- `MarginEngine.js` → `packages/shared/src/business-logic/MarginEngine.ts` (copy-paste ready, no deps)
- `statusColors` utility → `packages/shared/src/utils/statusColors.ts`
- `FormField` component → `packages/shared/src/components/FormField.tsx`
- `ProgressBar` component → `packages/shared/src/components/ProgressBar.tsx`
- `dateHelpers` → `packages/shared/src/utils/dateHelpers.ts`
- `formatCurrency` → `packages/shared/src/utils/formatCurrency.ts`
- `Skeleton` → `packages/shared/src/components/Skeleton.tsx`

**Before KINNA-OS Phase 1 (MEDIUM complexity, required):**
- Trial/Subscription clock → `packages/shared/src/hooks/useTrialStatus.ts` + `TrialProvider.tsx`
- Leakage detector → `packages/shared/src/business-logic/LeakageDetector.ts`
- Module activation hook → `packages/shared/src/hooks/useModuleState.ts`
- OnboardingWizard shell → `packages/shared/src/components/OnboardingShell.tsx`

**Do NOT extract yet:**
- `DataBridge.js` — monolith, too coupled to Ignition mobile/local-first. Extract pieces as needed.
- QB invoice pattern — wait until KINNA-OS accounting requirements are clear.
- CSV importer, hardware registry — Ignition-specific, no cross-vertical need yet.

**Initial entries above are seeded from the Session 1a audit findings and the button audit folded into PLATFORM_AUDIT.md in this session (1b). Future entries are added by Claude Code or David whenever Honest Friction surfaces a workaround that is intentionally executed against architectural intent.**

## 3. HANDOFF

> Rewritten at the end of every session.
> The next Claude Code session reads this first.

### 2026-06-14 — THUNDER HOUSEKEEPING: track recon artifacts + CLAUDE.md back under budget

**Type:** Docs/git only. Zero code/schema/migrations/shared-module edits. Two commits:
1. Tracked the two read-only margin-leakage recon artifacts that were `??` (`MARGIN-LEAKAGE-PRECONDITIONS.md` + `MARGIN-SYSTEM-INVENTORY.md` under docs/cost-to-produce/) — content unchanged — so `MARGIN-LEAKAGE-RESEARCH-LOG.md`'s citations point at repo files, not just disk.
2. Archived superseded 2026-06-13 FINISH + UNTANGLE handoffs to `docs/handoff-archive.md` (reverse-chron). **CLAUDE.md 703 → 582** (under 600). Clean text move; only RECORD + this entry remain inline.

**Left unstaged (pre-existing, not mine):** `.claude/settings.json`, `docs/cost-to-produce/LOT-POPULATION-PRECONDITIONS.md`. AC: N/A. **Next steps:** unchanged from RECORD below; plus decide on the unstaged LOT-POPULATION change.

---

### 2026-06-13 — THUNDER RECORD: cultivar_plants cleanup + PMI result field VERIFIED & recorded; CLAUDE.md trimmed; lot-population recon

**Type:** Docs-only (record verified state + CLAUDE.md archive cut) + read-only recon. Zero code, zero schema, zero migrations, zero shared-module logic.

**Session mandate:** Record the two now-RUN-and-catalog-verified migrations, archive pre-UNTANGLE handoff entries to get CLAUDE.md back toward budget, and run a read-only LOOK that sizes the first Cost-to-Produce build (lot population + first MarginEngine caller).

**STEP 0 GATE confirmed:** Last handoff = THUNDER FINISH (cultivar_plants policy cleanup). No shared modules touched. Off Limits (Part 7) clear (oauth.ts, auth.ts, old project, run migrations untouched).

**PART 1 — RECORDED (both migrations now RUN + catalog-confirmed by David):**
- **cultivar_plants policy cleanup** (`20260613_cultivar_plants_policy_cleanup.sql`) — V1 (exactly 3 policies: anon_select_plants + cultivar_plants_owner_select + cultivar_plants_owner_all), V2 (zero public/ALL — write-hole shape gone, AC-3), V3 (RLS enabled) ALL PASS. `cultivar_plants_owner_all` carries owner-or-member predicate on qual AND with_check.
- **PMI result field** (`20260613_business_service_log_result.sql`) — `business_service_log.result` column present (text, nullable) with CHECK `business_service_log_result_check` = (PASS / NEEDS_ATTENTION / FAIL).
- Verification doc `docs/verification/20260613_cultivar_plants_verification.md` Part B filled → doc marked VERIFIED (both halves).
- PLATFORM_STATE: `cultivar_plants` → **WIRED (verified, catalog-confirmed)** (dropped the "policy cleanup pending" qualifier); `business_service_log.result` → schema VERIFIED; stale "David must run" warnings removed from PMI.tsx + PMI page rows.
- **No pending migrations remain.** PMI/cleanup carry-forward items dropped from David's next-steps.

**PART 2 — CLAUDE.md archive cut:** Moved the 5 pre-UNTANGLE 2026-06-13 entries (VALIDATE-THEN-CLOSE, VOICE-SCHEMA, INVENTORIES, PMI, AC-5) to `docs/handoff-archive.md` (top, reverse-chron). **CLAUDE.md: 880 → 671 lines.** Kept: rules/standards, Part 9 protocol, FINISH + UNTANGLE handoffs. ⚠️ Still ~71 over the 600 soft budget — the two kept handoffs (FINISH + UNTANGLE) are large; archive them next session once superseded, or trim §2 reference blocks (deliberately NOT done here per "clean cut — move text, change nothing else").

**PART 3 — LOT-POPULATION RECON (read-only, sizes next build):** persisted to `docs/cost-to-produce/LOT-POPULATION-PRECONDITIONS.md`. Bottom line:
1. **Lot row creation = WIRING** — `BusinessInventory.tsx:168` already INSERTs business_inventory rows via the `/inventory` form. The missing piece is the LINK: nothing yet sets `cultivar_plants.inventory_id`, so a small linking step/UI is the only net-new work.
2. **FK supports it cleanly** — `cultivar_plants.inventory_id → business_inventory(id) ON DELETE SET NULL` (untangle migration line 55); many identity rows → one qty-of-SKU lot (many-to-one). Matches the settled mapping.
3. **MarginEngine config = NET-NEW for Cultivar** — shared `MarginEngine.ts` takes `config: MarginEngineConfig = DEFAULT_MARGIN_CONFIG` ({slabs[], pricingTiers[], overheadPerUnit}). Ignition callers source config from DataBridge localStorage (`MarginEngine.getConfig()`); Cultivar has NO equivalent config source (business_modules.config unused). Cost input is solved (`business_inventory.unit_cost`); the config object is the gap.

**AC compliance:** N/A — docs + read-only only. No schema, no shared identifiers.
**No new env vars, functions, pages, or migrations.**

**Next steps for David:**
1. **Lot population** (next build step, gated separately on LAWNS yes) — INSERT business_inventory rows for LAWNS SKUs via `/inventory` (UI exists), then build the small link step that sets `cultivar_plants.inventory_id` per tag → restores QR checkout.
2. Decide config source for the first Cultivar MarginEngine caller (constants file vs. new table vs. business_modules.config) — see LOT-POPULATION-PRECONDITIONS.md §3.
3. (Optional housekeeping) Archive FINISH + UNTANGLE handoffs next session to push CLAUDE.md under 600.

### 🟡 HOUSEKEEPING (AC-1: variation lives in one declarative place)

One principle applied to three domains — schema, docs, vertical setup — sequenced AFTER
the demo. Together they close the gap between "works now" and "new vertical = one config
file, zero component edits."

**Schema — Noun Purge** (audit #1/#2/#5/#6 in `docs/audits/platform-naming-vertical-leak-audit-2026-06-03.md`)
Do as a set, not piecemeal.
- [x] `nursery_modules` → `business_modules` ✅ 2026-06-04 — migration written, 6 API/hook files repointed, membership-scoped RLS, build clean. ⚠️ David must run migration in Supabase SQL editor before deploying, then run `node scripts/verify-business-modules.mjs` to confirm counts, then `DROP TABLE nursery_modules CASCADE;`
- [ ] `nursery_profiles` → `business_profiles` (migration + update OnboardingWizard + Settings consumers)
- [ ] `AIEngine.ts` — rename `shopId`/`shop_id` → `businessId`/`business_id` across all 9 public methods;
      update 3 Ignition modules that import these (IgnitionAudit, IgnitionCipher, PredictiveKey)
- [ ] `packages/shared/src/qr/print.ts` — rename `nurseryName` → `businessName`, `.nursery` CSS → `.business-name`;
      update one call site in Cultivar PlantProfile

**Docs — Doc Reorg** (single-source every fact; reference, don't copy)
- [ ] Lean CLAUDE.md to rules + state + pointers only — no architecture prose duplicated here
- [ ] PLATFORM_STRATEGY.md is the sole architecture home (already partial — continue)
- [ ] BUILT-INVENTORY.md links to audit docs via POINTERS (capability entry + reference link), never inlines audit content. Keep the index lean and scannable. Audit docs stay separate and authoritative for detail.
- [ ] Single-source the "TRACE — Who We Are" philosophy block across all docs (sync or point; eliminate copies)
- [ ] Enforce chronological THOUGHTS.md + grep-by-date recovery workflow

**Vertical Setup — Vertical Config Extraction** (variable inventory in `docs/audits/vertical-config-variable-inventory-2026-06-03.md`)
Audit half DONE (read-only, 2026-06-04). Refactor half is post-demo.
- [ ] Build `packages/shared/src/config/VerticalConfig.ts` — typed config object per business_type
      (identity, theme, copy, vocabulary, modules, integrations, behavior defaults)
- [ ] Seed config entries for cultivar-os and ignition-os (migrate existing scattered values in)
- [ ] Thread config reads through shared components (OwnerSignup, tiles, discovery, notifications)
- [ ] Success test: new vertical = one config file + zero component edits

### 🟢 POST-DEMO (Phase 1 — after signing)

- [ ] Settings page: Lauren can set default install price at nursery level
      (nurseries.default_install_price column + /settings UI)
      Install price currently hardcoded per plant in seed data at $225
- [ ] Per-plant install price override on plant detail page
      (plants.install_price editable in plant profile UI)
- [x] ~~Tighten nursery_modules RLS~~ — resolved 2026-06-04 via `business_modules` membership-scoped RLS
- [ ] Populate nurseries.owner_id for LAWNS row
      (currently NULL — blocks owner-scoped RLS)
- [ ] Contractor tier management
- [ ] Seasonal perishable module
- [ ] Business insights tile
- [ ] Measure & photo intake
- [ ] configureAuth() vertical wrapper
- [ ] verticalConfig.ts master switch
- [ ] Separate Supabase project for ignition-os
- [ ] SOS amendment filed
- [ ] builtwithcai.com product page live
- [ ] Calendly booking link set up

## 6. STRICT CODING GUIDELINES

1. Never edit existing migrations — append only
2. No placeholder code — fully functional or documented
3. UI system:
   - Primary: #27500A (forest green)
   - Background: #EAF3DE (sage)
   - Netting prompt: #A32D2D border, amber bg
   - Buttons: 48px min height, full-width mobile
   - No web fonts, no animations
4. Never hardcode URLs, keys, or localhost
5. Database writes: always handle errors
6. Integration failure never blocks an order
7. Tile grid: desktop/tablet only (768px+)

---

## 7. OFF LIMITS THIS SESSION

- packages/shared/src/quickbooks/oauth.ts
  (IGNITION_OS_DATA hardcoding — post-demo fix)
- packages/shared/src/supabase/auth.ts
  (PIN auth — post-demo refactor)
- Old Supabase project ufsgqckbxdtwviqjjtos
  — never reference in cultivar-os code (exception: the drop migration
  20260602_ignition_drop_team_tables.sql targets this project intentionally)
- Any already-run Supabase migrations
- ~~nursery_modules RLS policy authenticated_select_nursery_modules~~ — retired 2026-06-04, replaced by business_modules membership-scoped policy
- main branch — multi-tenant-extraction was merged 2026-06-03. All work now goes directly to main or feature branches as appropriate.

---

## 8. APP PHILOSOPHY

Golden Rule: If it takes more steps than writing on paper,
nursery staff won't use it.

The Regina Rule: Every add-on that can only be applied at
planting time must have urgency copy. The system closes
the gap that cost Regina a 40-minute drive home.

Lauren's ROI: 29 hours/month in manual work eliminated.
$149/month cost. Net benefit: $1,906/month month 1.

## 9. END-OF-SESSION PROTOCOL

Full protocol (steps 1–16, file-size check, gap/debt routing, gap graduation, schema verification gate):
**[docs/end-of-session-protocol.md](docs/end-of-session-protocol.md)**

**MID-SESSION GATE — SCHEMA VERIFICATION:** Any session that creates or alters a table, column, policy, constraint, FK, or trigger is NOT done until Thunder outputs catalog-backed verification proving the change. Queries hit the live catalog (`information_schema` / `pg_catalog`), NEVER the builder's memory. Structure AND RLS must both be proven. Standard query set in `docs/end-of-session-protocol.md` → SCHEMA VERIFICATION GATE section.

**Quick reference — mandatory close sequence:**
1. Update Handoff (Part 3) + Active Tasks (Part 4) + Off Limits (Part 7)
2. Confirm no hardcoded URLs or keys
3. `git add CLAUDE.md && git commit && git push`
4. Tailwind drift check · Documentation propagation check · Factual correction capture
5. Runbook if env/infra work · AC compliance check · STANDARDS compliance check
6. Gap graduation sweep · PLATFORM_STATE.md level changes
7. **Update BUILT-INVENTORY.md** — bump `Last updated:` to today + add/update every capability changed this session. **Verify line 4 date = today before committing.** (Full protocol: step 17 in docs/end-of-session-protocol.md)

## 10. SESSION STARTER

Paste this at the start of every Claude Code session:

```
Read CLAUDE.md before we begin.
Read PLATFORM_STATE.md — verified current state (LEVEL + LOCATION + EVIDENCE).

Current session: [describe task]
Today's goal: [specific deliverable]

Before writing any code confirm:
1. What was completed last session (from Handoff)
2. What shared modules this session needs
3. Those modules exist in packages/shared/src/ AND are at WIRED or WORKS level in PLATFORM_STATE.md
4. `docs/built-inventory.md` `Last updated:` is not older than the latest capability commit — if stale, FLAG before using it to answer "was X built?"
5. `docs/inventory-functions.md`, `docs/inventory-env.md`, `docs/inventory-ai.md` dates — if any is older than the latest commit touching its domain, FLAG as stale before answering "what functions/vars/AI routes do we have?"

Do not start until you confirm all five.
Do not touch ignition-os, old Supabase project,
or QB oauth.ts.
```
