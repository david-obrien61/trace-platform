# TRACE — SESSION BOOTSTRAP (paste this FIRST in any new chat)

> **What this is:** the single front-door doc — and the CANONICAL status front-page. Paste this at the start of every new Lightning (Claude-in-chat) session to get current in ~90 seconds. It is the MAP, not the territory — deep detail lives in the reference library (§7) and the feeder docs each ⚡ line links to. Structure is FIXED; only the values change. Update at session-end (see END-OF-SESSION PROTOCOL doc + CLAUDE.md §9).

Maintenance loop wired as step 6 of operating-doctrine/end-of-session-protocol.md so both stay self-maintaining. Existing COLD-START / OPERATING FACTS / ⚡ ACTIVE STATUS / 📋 24-board / §7b / §A all intact. Prior: Lightning load-menu added (§7b: subject → verified .md files to drag) + COLD-START ritual at top + two standing WORKFLOW rules banked (prompt format = one copy-paste block · humor = Cleese/Fawlty/Python deadpan, full mode earned). Prior: VERIFY-BEFORE-BUILD as the top-level standing principle in ⚡ OPERATING FACTS — cross-refs §0 #1, CLAUDE.md §10 #6, DECISIONS.md OP-8, no duplicate copies; ⚡ OPERATING FACTS constants block at top; ⚡ ACTIVE STATUS + 📋 24-CAPABILITY BOARD = canonical status front-page; feeder docs point up to it.)

> **COLD-START (how to get Lightning current fast):** Paste TWO things at session start —
> (1) this file (TRACE-SESSION-BOOTSTRAP.md), and (2) the current HANDOFF — which lives in
> **CLAUDE.md Part 3 (HANDOFF)**, rewritten every session as the "what were we mid-sentence on"
> record. *(There is no `docs/handoffs/` folder — the canonical session handoff is CLAUDE.md
> Part 3; `docs/handoff-archive.md` holds older rolled-off entries.)* Then state the session goal.
> If the goal touches a specific subsystem, ALSO drag over the .md files listed for that subject
> in the LIGHTNING LOAD-MENU (§7b). Lightning can read past CONVERSATIONS on its own (just ask:
> "pull up where we left off on X") but CANNOT open repo files — those must be pasted/dragged.
> Conversations = what we said; docs = what's written in the repo.

---

## ⚡ OPERATING FACTS — the constants (rarely change)

> Stable project constants Lightning otherwise re-derives or guesses at session-start. NOT task-state (that lives in ⚡ ACTIVE STATUS below, which changes every close). Pointers over detail. Inclusion test: *true across sessions AND Lightning gets it wrong without it.* If a value changes session-to-session it does NOT belong here.

**VERIFY-BEFORE-BUILD (always, no exceptions)** — the standing principle above all build work.
> Before building ANYTHING, look at what already exists first — read the code, the tables, the existing capability. Never build from memory, assumption, or "I think we have X." Every build/recon starts by confirming current state against the repo (file:line evidence), THEN scoping the delta. This prevents: rebuilding what exists, drift, wrong-target edits, and scope creep. The pattern is always: (1) what do we have, (2) what's the real delta, (3) build only the delta. A recon or a verify-first pass is NOT overhead — it's the cheapest insurance against the most expensive mistakes. When in doubt, read before you write.
>
> Reinforced by (point here, don't duplicate): **§0 #1 CHECK-BEFORE-BUILD GATE** (the anti-rebuild special case — assume it may already exist, esp. in Ignition) · **CLAUDE.md §10 Session Starter #6** (verify-before-build: check built-inventory + grep before NEW capability) · **DECISIONS.md OP-8** (HAVE/NEED/WANT three-lens recon — how a verify-first LOOK reports, bound as a recon gate in CLAUDE.md §9 #10). This bootstrap line is the canonical top-level statement of the principle; those are its enforcement points.

**STRUCTURE-LAST (the structure tax is paid by the MACHINE, not the human)** — the standing platform principle behind every capture, schema, and onboarding surface.
> Take input however it arrives (voice, photo, typed, scraped site, QB export); structure emerges on READ. The grower's "structured mess" already IS structure, just latent — the system pays the structure tax in the backend (cheap), never the human up front (the wall that kept them out). Economic spine: arbitrage falling machine-structuring cost against flat human-structuring cost — what incumbents can't follow. Field-confirmed: ~88% of growers have NO per-item structure (Barryhill: "no inventory system," stock tracked in heads) → drive the cost-of-feeding-the-system to zero; the work they already do (the count) builds the catalog. Re-test on drift: does a surface ask the owner to structure their world before it helps? Push the structuring into the backend. **Canonical: DECISIONS.md OP-10** (+ small-grower expression); product home `NORTH-STAR.md`. Companions: OP-5 anti-Nelson, D-23 faithful/connected, D-24 rigid-spine/flexible-edge, D-26 dual lexicon.

**DEPLOY / ENV**
- Deploy = **merge to `main` → Vercel auto-deploys from main**. No per-branch previews — to test a branch, merge it first. Merge-to-main is **David's explicit go**, not automatic.
- Vercel plan: **Hobby — 12 serverless-function ceiling** (`api/` is AT the cap; a 13th function silently fails the deploy → consolidate or upgrade to Pro — tech-debt #41). Supabase: **free tier**. Both → Pro at the first-paying-customer launch gate (PLATFORM_STATE ⛔).
- Live prod env keys (cultivar `bgobkjcopcxusjsetfob`, names only — already set, don't re-suggest creating): `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`/`ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`/`SERVICE_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `QBO_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET`/`REDIRECT_URI`/`ENVIRONMENT`, `OCR_PRIMARY_MODEL`/`FALLBACK_MODEL`, `BLOTATO_API_KEY`, `VITE_DEMO_BUSINESS_ID`, `VITE_TAX_RATE`, `VITE_APP_URL`. Full list → `docs/inventory-env.md`.

**DATA / RISK**
- **ZERO real users — the DB is ALL TEST DATA** until David explicitly says otherwise. No production-data risk; changes can be **bold**. ONE exception: **RLS / tenant-isolation is sacred** (the security architecture ships to real nurseries). Posture: **data bold, security careful**.

**WORKFLOW**
- Lightning writes prompts (never touches the repo) · Thunder executes · **David applies ALL SQL as `postgres`** and owner-proves live. Two bars: **BUILDER-COMPLETE** (committed, verify green) ≠ **OWNER-PROVEN** (David live-confirms via the TRACE trail).
- **Prompt authorship:** Lightning writes ALL Thunder prompts (full context + verify-first + standing rules baked in). David relays them verbatim and decides/owner-proves — **David does NOT compose Thunder instructions from scratch** (avoids underspecified/iffy instructions). Path when David needs Thunder to do something: **David tells Lightning the goal → Lightning writes the prompt → David relays it.**
- **Prompt format:** Lightning delivers every Thunder task as ONE clean copy-paste block (so David uses the copy icon and pastes verbatim) — never a goal for David to assemble, never split across prose.
- **Humor (working method):** the register is John Cleese / Fawlty Towers / Monty Python deadpan, and full "Cleese mode" is EARNED — fired only on a NAMED, proven problem, never on a hope (premature celebration = smoke). Deadpan-precise with codename whimsy by default. (Full doctrine: `docs/operating-doctrine/lightning-david-partnership.md`.)
- **ALL `[TRACE:*]` emits stay ON** until David explicitly lifts them.

**IDENTITY / CONSTANTS**
- Supabase: cultivar (active) **`bgobkjcopcxusjsetfob`** · Ignition (do-not-touch from cultivar code) `ufsgqckbxdtwviqjjtos`.
- David: `david_obrien2016@outlook.com` · user_id `98f4e56b-cd27-4099-a9d8-5c8cbb63d00f`. TRACE business_id **`45830ba7…` [confirm full UUID]**. LAWNS (demo) business_id `a1b2c3d4-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`.
- Architecture Constants **AC-1..AC-4** + naming (`platform_`/`business_`, no vertical nouns in shared schema) → detail in **PLATFORM_STRATEGY.md** (named here, not inlined).
- Demo target **LAWNS** (Leander, TX). **Terry** = owner (tech-shy, approval gatekeeper) · **Lauren Bishop** = manager (the real economic buyer). Demo date **[confirm with David — TBD]**.

**DON'T-RE-LITIGATE** (pointers, not detail → `DECISIONS.md`)
- `person_id` = **overlay, never the auth principal** (RLS stays on `auth.uid()`). · Standard-by-value rule (CLAUDE.md §6 r10). · Semantic-dup / rule-of-three (§6.8). · "Contractor" = **customer tier**, not an entity.

## 🧵 ARC MAP — the platform as FLOWS, not tiles (integration / drift / landmines live here)

> The 24-board below tracks flat TILES. This tracks ARCS — the end-to-end flows that thread through many tiles. A spine can be all-green at the piece level and still be INCOHERENT end-to-end (a built piece wired to nothing, an absent middle). That gap — and every auth/irreversible LANDMINE — is invisible on the flat board; it lives here.
> Per-piece legend: 🟢 built+proven · 🟡 built-not-wired / not-proven · 🔴 net-new / absent · ⚪ conversation-only / unverified.
> **Every status below traces to a file:line or doc section (verified this pass, not from memory).** Maintain via the end-of-session loop (operating-doctrine/end-of-session-protocol.md step 6).

### 1. FRONT-DOOR ARC — register → invite → scrape-while-away → return → reveal → validate/conflict → seed → vertical → alive dashboard
- **SPINE:** register 🔴 → invite 🔴 → scrape-while-away 🔴 → return 🔴 → reveal 🟡 → validate/conflict 🟢(entered incl. **address**)/🔴(addr→Google) → seed 🟢(catalog) → vertical 🟡 → alive-dashboard 🟡
- **STATUS per piece:** register=🔴 (no minimal screen; entry IS full `OwnerSignup`) · invite=🔴 (only a TEAM-MEMBER invite, `acceptInvitation.ts:53`; no prospect token) · scrape-while-away=🔴 (everything synchronous in-request, `ingest.ts`) · return=🔴 · reveal=🟡 (`DiscoveryGlimpse.tsx` "Here's what we found" — built + now CARRIES the conflict + seed; still a synchronous *signup vertical step*, not a standalone entry) · validate/conflict=🟢 **WIRED 2026-06-26 (ledger #47)** — `compareEnteredVsSite` gained an `address` field (`compare.ts:36-46`) + is now called from `api/discovery/ingest.ts` normal flow (returns `discrepancies`), rendered as a hedged conflict in the reveal with owner-RLS "Use site value" write-back; 🔴 address→Google fork still absent (no geocoder, DEFERRED) · seed=🟢 **WIRED 2026-06-26** — `populateCatalog` runs as `action=populate` on the same ingest fn, fired foreground from the reveal ("Added N items") · vertical=🟡 · alive-dashboard=🟡 (catalog now seeds on signup via the reveal; was 🔴 `populateCatalog` CLI-only — owner-proof owed)
- **ARC STATUS:** 🟡 **the SYNCHRONOUS reveal arc is now coherent** (reveal → address-conflict → catalog-seed → alive dashboard, all auth-free, ledger #47, owner-proof owed on one deploy); the async invite / scrape-while-away / return-later choreography is still **entirely absent** (DEFERRED — 🔴, forces the auth landmine).
- **HOME DOC(S):** `docs/decisions/2026-06-26-front-door-arc-recon.md` (ledger #45) · **ledger #47 (sync promotion built)** · `DISCOVERY_MODULE_BRIEF.md` · `docs/CONCEPT-customer-url-integration-and-autopopulate.md`
- **LANDMINE:** 🚨 **AUTH.** The full async arc inverts today's account→business→scrape order (scrape must run *before* account) → forces the auth-principal reconciliation (`OwnerSignup.tsx:397` signUp, businesses-insert-needs-`owner_id` `:282`, a new pre-auth→`owner_id` claim/merge). The **synchronous reveal + bug-fixes** (compare+address, catalog-populate, QBO/tax/bookend/naming) promoted **auth-free 2026-06-26 (ledger #47)** — boundary never crossed. The Google/address geocode branch + the async arc remain the only auth-/key-gated work.
- **OFF-COURSE / EXTRA:** ⚪ async-invite choreography + ⚪ structured-query architecture (vertical-assembles-the-call) are **conversation-only — owed a doc home** (flagged in the front-door recon, not yet captured).

### 2. OCR / DOCUMENT-ROUTING ARC — capture → extract (one engine) → infer type → confirm → fan-out to many destinations
- **SPINE:** capture 🟢 → extract 🟢 → infer-type 🟡 → confirm 🟢 → fan-out{ receipts/cost 🟢·🔴 · invoice→delivery 🟢 · invoice→inventory 🔴 · leakage 🔴 · audit 🔴 · cross-vertical 🔴 }
- **STATUS per piece:** capture=🟢 (`ReceiptKeeper.tsx:204` + `imageCompression`) · extract=🟢 ONE engine `api/receipts/ocr.ts:309-313` Gemini→Claude, **`shape:'receipt'|'invoice'` param** `:281` · infer-type=🟡 (shape HARD-PINNED `'invoice'` `ReceiptKeeper.tsx:33`; receipt-vs-invoice is a post-OCR *label* `:288-289`, nothing auto-routes the extraction) · confirm=🟢 (`:944-994` + line-item grid) · receipts-write=🟢 (`:422`) but **cost_object spawn=🔴** (dead-ends at `receipts`) · invoice→delivery=🟢 (`api/customers/create.ts:94-101`, consolidated) · invoice→inventory=🔴 net-new (`line_items` extracted but no `business_inventory` mapper) · leakage=🔴 ("coming" stub `:989-992`) · audit=🔴 (table exists, **no app writer**) · cross-vertical=🔴 (cultivar-local; Ignition uses a separate remote engine)
- **ARC STATUS:** 🟡 coherent capture→extract→infer→confirm + TWO live fan-outs (receipts, delivery); **dead-ends after** — inventory scoped-not-built, leakage/audit/cross-vertical absent.
- **HOME DOC(S):** `docs/decisions/OCR-router-spine-recon.md` · `docs/decisions/OCR-into-inventory-reuse-verify.md`
- **LANDMINE:** `api/receipts/ocr.ts` is the credential-bearing seam (Gemini/Anthropic keys, server-only) — a secrets seam, not an irreversible-write seam. No Off-Limits.
- **OFF-COURSE / EXTRA:** receipt→cost_object writer (recon'd, banked) · invoice→inventory build (~70% reuse, the NEXT demo build) · per-receipt deep-link not built · 🐞 **DISCOUNT-LINE bug (recon-first, master bank #64):** parser models "DISCOUNT EACH" as standalone negative line items + drops qty/unit-price ("2 @ 6.28") → a false "$3.06 below total / tax-tip?" warning on a receipt that actually reconciles; OCR read fine, the LINE-ITEM MODEL is wrong (needs qty + unit_price + per_unit_discount + extended net; discount = cost-to-produce signal). LOOK before fixing (OCR adapter vs line-item type). → CLOSE-OUT-LEDGER GENUINELY OPEN.

### 3. COST-TO-PRODUCE ARC — recurring/operating costs → labor → margin → compute → (forward-run) suggestion engine
- **SPINE:** recurring/operating 🟢 → labor 🟢 → margin 🟢 → compute 🟢 → forward-run-suggestion ⚪
- **STATUS per piece:** recurring/operating=🟢 owner-proven (`OperatingCosts.tsx:131`, sole `cost_objects node_type=COST` writer, 2026-06-18) · labor=🟢 owner-proven (D-12, `CostToProduceSettings.tsx` Block 2 + `labor_resources`) · margin=🟢 (`CostToProduce.ts:326` → shared `MarginEngine`) · compute=🟢 owner-proven (`analyze()` ÷N D-16 Model-B `:430-451` + by-project `ProjectCostTree`/`CostRollup.ts`) · forward-run suggestion=⚪ **conversation-only, confirmed ABSENT** (no code; `MASTER_BRIEF.md:368` "cost-to-produce run FORWARD")
- **ARC STATUS:** ✅ coherent + owner-proven for the BACKWARD question (capture→labor→margin→compute→by-project); the FORWARD suggestion engine is doctrine-only.
- **HOME DOC(S):** `DECISIONS.md` (D-8..D-19) · `docs/DECISION-*.md` (cost docs) · `MASTER_BRIEF.md` PART 4 (forward-run)
- **LANDMINE:** 🔒 the **cost wall** — `view_costs` RLS ENFORCED at the data layer (`20260622_oauth_secrets_relocation_and_cost_wall.sql:142-153`; `has_permission`); a Staff session reads `200 []`. Any cost surface must respect it.
- **OFF-COURSE / EXTRA:** unified margin store + cost/margin history (D-13, DEFERRED) · nested projects + BI what-if/blocker wedge (DEFERRED).

### 4. SUGGESTION / SURFACING ARC — pattern-surfacing from owned data (the Regina Principle, product north star)
- **SPINE:** Tier-1 offerings→buyers ⚪ → Tier-2 latent service lines ⚪ → capacity gate (Path A slack / Path B ROI) ⚪ → routing-as-slack-readout ⚪ → map-as-visualizer ⚪
- **STATUS per piece:** ALL ⚪ conversation-only. Grep of `packages/` for a surfacing/suggestion/capacity engine = **zero implementation**. The only artifact is ONE forward-declared tile `tileRegistry.ts:187` (`opportunities`, `status:'planned'`, `depends_on:'services'`) — registry entry, no logic.
- **ARC STATUS:** ⚪ entirely conversation-only doctrine; **NO engine built**. Hard-blocked: it hangs on a **services data model that does not exist yet** (`MASTER_BRIEF.md:366`).
- **HOME DOC(S):** `MASTER_BRIEF.md` PART 4 (`:312-410`) · `DECISIONS.md` OP-9 (Regina Principle) + D-19 (opportunity-cost layer)
- **LANDMINE:** none. (Dependency, not landmine: services unmodeled = the spine this whole arc needs.)
- **OFF-COURSE / EXTRA:** the **services data model** (JOB-like service object, D-19) is the missing spine · three suggestion types (`MASTER_BRIEF.md:403`) · social-intelligence + PMI surfaces are the same engine pointed elsewhere (`:478`, `:488`).

### 5. DELIVERY / ROUTING ARC — schedule → day-group → select stops → bookend (business→stops→business) → Google Maps handoff
- **SPINE:** schedule 🟢 → day-group 🟢 → select-stops 🟢 → bookend 🟢(real)/🟡(demo builder, WIRED 2026-06-26) → Maps-handoff 🟢 · [geocoding 🔴]
- **STATUS per piece:** schedule=🟢 (OCR-invoice `customers/create.ts:94-101` + cart `orders`) · day-group=🟢 (`DeliverySchedule.tsx:94-106`) · select-stops=🟢 ("Route this day" `:152-166`) · bookend(real)=🟢 origin=`businesses.address` round-trip unshift+push (`DeliveryRoute.tsx:80-82,181-191`; **1-stop OWNER-PROVEN 2026-06-26 ledger #42, multi-stop owed** — only 1 live delivery, no seeder) · bookend(DEMO/onboarding builder)=🟡 **WIRED 2026-06-26 (ledger #47)** — `OnboardingWizard.DeliveryWizardPath.buildRoute` now bookends business→stops→business via `nurseryInfo.address` (mirrors the live seam); BUILDER-COMPLETE, owner-proof owed · Maps-handoff=🟢 (`DeliveryRoute.tsx:37-40` `buildMapsUrl`) · geocoding=🔴 absent (no geocoder, no Maps key — Google geocodes the raw strings)
- **ARC STATUS:** 🟢 coherent real path (schedule→day-group→select→bookend→Maps); live **multi-stop** bookend is owner-proof-owed; the DEMO onboarding route builder now ALSO bookends (ledger #47, owner-proof owed).
- **HOME DOC(S):** `docs/built-inventory.md` (delivery loop) · `docs/decisions/2026-06-25-routing-seeder-seam-recon.md` · `docs/decisions/2026-06-25-address-spine-defect-recon.md`
- **LANDMINE:** none irreversible (read-only of `deliveries`/`orders` + a Maps URL handoff). Net-new geocoder = mis-geocode risk (Wimberley→San Marcos), a build risk not a code landmine.
- **OFF-COURSE / EXTRA:** geo-seeder (3–4 verified nearby stops from the business address — recon'd, **hard-gated on a geocoder + key**) · routing-as-capacity-readout (the link into ARC 4).

### 6. DISCOVERY ARC — website read → two-pass (Haiku identity / Sonnet analysis) → synthesis email → seed.ts → catalog-populate
- **SPINE:** website-read 🟢 → two-pass 🟢 → synthesis-email 🟢 → seed.ts 🟡 → catalog-populate 🟡
- **STATUS per piece:** website-read=🟢 (`adapters/website.ts:87` GET + `stripHtml` + `/about` fallback) · two-pass=🟢 (`engine.ts:24` Haiku identity / `:72` Sonnet analysis) · synthesis-email=🟢 **code DOES send** (`synthesis.ts:19` → `ingest.ts:186` → `send.ts:55` Resend; v0 "SHIPPED" corroborated) · seed.ts=🟡 built but conditional (fires only when `businessId` in ingest body, **not wired to signup** — v2 gap, `ingest.ts:169`) · catalog-populate=🟡 built, **CLI-only** (`populate.ts:128` ← `scripts/populate-catalog.ts`; profile-persist depends on the gated `20260621` migration)
- **ARC STATUS:** 🟡 coherent pipeline but spans two surfaces — the ingest endpoint drives read/two-pass/synthesis/send/conditional-seed (live); catalog-populate is CLI-only and seed isn't wired to signup. (This arc is the substrate the FRONT-DOOR arc consumes.)
- **HOME DOC(S):** `DISCOVERY_MODULE_BRIEF.md` · `docs/DISCOVERY-ONBOARDING-CONCEPT-COMPILED.md`
- **LANDMINE:** none irreversible. Gap: discovery writes nothing durable to the DB (in-memory one request, v2-horizon, `DISCOVERY_MODULE_BRIEF.md:171`).
- **OFF-COURSE / EXTRA:** discovery persistence (v2) · recognition-moment **status contradiction** (committed in `CONCEPT-customer-url…:108-113` vs "do not build" in `THOUGHTS.md:15` — David reconciles).

### 7. IDENTITY / ROLES / SECURITY ARC — auth principal → membership resolution → role/permission chokepoint → RLS wall → audit (status from ledger + migration file:line; not re-swept this pass)
- **SPINE:** auth-principal 🟢 → membership-resolution 🟢 → role/permission chokepoint 🟢 → RLS wall 🟢 → role-config console 🟡 → audit-log 🟢(spine)/🔴(first writer)
- **STATUS per piece:** auth-principal=🟢 (`auth.uid()`, Off-Limits) · membership-resolution=🟢 (`BusinessProvider.tsx`; `is_active_member()` canonical RLS, ledger #3 owner-proven) · chokepoint+permissions=🟢 (`can()` + financial-permission backfill, ledger #2) · RLS cost/write wall=🟢 read-wall owner-proven / write-wall built (ledger #4/#5) · role-config console=🟡 `/roles` BUILDER-COMPLETE, owner-proof owed (ledger #16/#16B) · audit-log=🟢 spine OWNER-PROVEN (ledger #19) but 🔴 **first writer NOT built** (#19B, factory-reset audit row)
- **ARC STATUS:** 🟢 the security wall is real and largely owner-proven; the audit *spine* exists but **nothing writes to it yet** (#19B owed) and the role console is deploy-owner-proof-owed.
- **HOME DOC(S):** `docs/CLOSE-OUT-LEDGER.md` rows #2/#3/#4/#5/#16/#19 · `PLATFORM_STRATEGY.md` (AC-2/AC-3)
- **LANDMINE:** 🚨 RLS / tenant-isolation is **sacred** (ships to real nurseries — "data bold, security careful"); `oauth.ts` + PIN-auth are Off-Limits.
- **OFF-COURSE / EXTRA:** Person-spine CP1/CP2 (`person_id` overlay, migration STAGED — see ⚡ ACTIVE STATUS) · audit first-writer (#19B, UNBLOCKED).

### 8. ASSET / INVENTORY / PMI ARC — assets → inventory → walk-and-count → preventive-maintenance schedule → service log (status from ledger + handoff file:line)
- **SPINE:** discovery-catalog 🟢 (+ size variants 🟡) → assets 🟢 → inventory 🟢 → walk-and-count 🟡 → PMI schedule 🟡 → service log 🟢 → (forward) reconciliation 🔴 · PMI↔Delivery ⚪
- **SIZE VARIANTS=🟡 BUILT catalog-side 2026-06-28 (ledger #62, `9f1063e`)** — discovery now captures WooCommerce size variants: `extractSizeVariants(rawHtml)` [deterministic, no AI — `data-product_variations` JSON + size `<select>` fallback, `normalizeSize` gallon canon] via a bounded `/product/<slug>` crawl (`fetchProductVariants`); `populate.ts` writes ONE `business_inventory` row per (variety × size), `variant_group`=parent slug, matched to the variety by `canonicalNameKey` (the L4 key); GATED migration `20260628_inventory_size_variants.sql` [`size`+`variant_group` text, David applies as postgres]; deploy-window safe; 31/0 unit (5/15/30/45 on LAWNS Vitex); BUILDER-COMPLETE, owner-proof owed after apply. **COUNT-SIDE size-picker = REQUIRED FOLLOW-ON (flagged, NOT built):** per-size rows make a Vitex scan return >1 same-name candidate → L4 `InventoryCount.tsx:263` AMBIGUOUS→UNKNOWN (the L5 NEED_CLARIFICATION seam the resolver already anticipates); land the picker before populating per-size rows live, or the owner-proven Vitex scan regresses to UNKNOWN.

## 📚 CAPTURE INDEX — the single retrieval point (so nothing is re-derived or re-captured)

> One row per captured decision/doctrine/concept. **The POINTER is the point — not the content** (one fact, one home; this references it). Read this index → know what exists and where, instead of re-deriving. Swept from the actual docs this pass (file:line / section). Maintain via the end-of-session loop (step 6): a capture without an index row is **not done**.
> ⚠️ **CONVERSATION-ONLY (owed a doc home — listed here so they're not lost, but they have no canonical doc yet):** async-invite-gated front-door choreography · structured-query architecture (vertical-assembles-the-call). Both flagged in the front-door recon; do NOT re-derive — capture them to a doc when built.

## 0. STANDING INSTRUCTIONS TO LIGHTNING (read first, every time)

1. **CHECK-BEFORE-BUILD GATE (anti-rebuild rule — the most important one).** Before designing or proposing a build of ANY capability, assume it MAY ALREADY EXIST — especially in **Ignition** (the mature reference vertical). Check §4 (What's Built) and the built-inventory. If it might exist, say so and propose a read-only audit FIRST. Do NOT design from scratch something that may already be built. *This rule exists because RBAC, the admin console, and auth were each designed/built more than once for lack of this check.*

2. **EXECUTE WHEN DIRECTED — don't ask "want me to?"** When David says "do it," "capture," "go," or has clearly directed — execute. Asking permission after a clear direction is a named failure mode. (Partnership doctrine §4, §9.)

3. **OPERATE AS LIGHTNING.** Composite voice (Doug=verification, Darren=directness, Binder=synthesis, Scott=dry edge). Calibrated pushback, not deferential, not contrarian. Push back with specific reasoning; receive correction without defensiveness. Full doctrine in `lightning-david-partnership.md`.

4. **CONTEXT DOES NOT PERSIST between sessions.** This is structural and won't change. The fix is THIS doc being current — not hoping Lightning remembers. The end-of-session protocol keeps it current so re-establishing context is one paste, not an hour of screenshots.

5. **Lightning ≠ Thunder.** Lightning (this chat) = strategy, diagnosis, writing prompts, capturing decisions; never edits the repo. Thunder (Claude Code in VS Code) = all repo/code/doc execution. Humor and exploration happen with Lightning; Thunder gets clean, literal, labeled instructions.

---

## 1. WHO

- **David O'Brien (Col Bender)** — solo founder, TRACE Enterprises. 40 yrs military/federal knowledge-management background. Away from hands-on code ~20 yrs; uses Claude as primary dev/strategy partner. Operating philosophy: "if I make you successful, then I'm ultimately successful." Non-extractive, family-owned by design (origin: NATO system dismantled after leadership change).
- **Family/team:** Andrew (full-stack dev, lives with David), Connor (infra/Kubernetes), Erin (ER nurse, potential healthcare vertical; on LAWNS as STAFF), Regina (wife, OLH program director, KINNA anchor pilot).
- **Two-Claude model:** **Lightning** = this chat (strategy/diagnosis/prompts). **Thunder** = Claude Code (execution against repo).

---

## 2. WHAT TRACE IS

A composable AI operating system for owner-operated small businesses. **One codebase, one deployment, infinite verticals.** Each vertical = a configured instance of the same shared platform. Unit of value = the **CAPABILITY** (atomic, vertical-agnostic), bundled into verticals. Three value buckets: CONNECT (adapter to what they have), FILL THE GAP (what they lack), SURFACE THE BETWEEN (cross-tile AI). Pitch: *"We don't replace your systems. We connect them, surface what matters, and fill the gaps you couldn't fill yourself."*

**Architecture constants (non-negotiable):**
- **AC-1:** variation lives in DATA not schema — no vertical nouns (nursery/shop/lawns) in shared tables, columns, RLS, routes, identifiers. Vertical identity = a `business_type` VALUE only.
- **AC-2:** RLS membership-scoped to `business_id` by default.
- **AC-3:** tenant isolation absolute.
- **AC-4:** settle once, encode as variable, stop relitigating.

---

## 3. VERTICALS & INFRA

| Vertical | What | Status | Supabase project | URL |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Ignition OS** | auto/diesel shop | MOST MATURE — the reference vertical (~47 commits). Much of the shared spine was built here first. | `ufsgqckbxdtwviqjjtos` | ignition-os.vercel.app |
| **Cultivar OS** | nurseries | Active demo target (LAWNS) | `bgobkjcopcxusjsetfob` | cultivar-os.vercel.app |
| **KINNA-OS** | nonprofits | Aug 1 2026 hard deadline (OLH Back-to-School) | (TBD) | — |
| CoolRunnings | home automation | local-first, Home Assistant | — | — |

- **Repo:** github.com/david-obrien61/trace-platform (private monorepo). `packages/shared/`, `packages/ignition-os/`, `packages/cultivar-os/`, etc.
- **Stack:** React + Vite + TypeScript · Supabase · Vercel.
- **business_type discriminators:** Cultivar=`'nursery'`, Ignition=`'shop'`.
- **Key IDs:** LAWNS business_id `a1b2c3d4-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`; JB Auto (Ignition test) `fb18f55e-ecb7-40a8-8616-a3c38ab11b93`.
- **⚠️ Two separate Supabase projects — never modify Ignition's from Cultivar code.**

---

## 4. WHAT'S BUILT (the anti-rebuild inventory — CHECK THIS BEFORE PROPOSING ANY BUILD)

> This section is the front-line defense against rebuilding. If a capability is listed here as built in a vertical, the job is PROMOTE/CONSUME, not rebuild. Deep detail → built-inventory.md / PLATFORM_AUDIT.md.

**Built in IGNITION (the mature vertical — most "do we have this?" answers are YES here):**
- **FULL RBAC ADMIN CONSOLE** ("ADMIN | COMMAND CENTER") — confirmed live 2026-06-04. Four tabs: TEAM (join code/QR, teams/grouping, invite), STAFF (member mgmt, invite, PIN reset), ROLES, SHOP SETTINGS. **ROLES tab:** system roles (ADMIN=14 perms, TECH=5, CUSTOMER=3, marked SYSTEM ROLE) + **ADD CUSTOM ROLE** (custom roles by name); permissions grouped by category (MODULES/FINANCIAL/ADMIN/TECH OPS/CUSTOMER), per-permission toggles, role→tile mapping, SAVE ROLE DEFINITIONS. **SHOP SETTINGS:** business profile + SYSTEM POLICY (Price Audit Mode, Bay Custody Tracking, **Auto-Lock Screen after 10 min** = device-session timeout, DOT Mandated Shop) + DANGER ZONE (Restart Onboarding, Simulate Trial Day, Factory Reset). → **This is near-complete RBAC + admin. Job = extract to shared, vertical-skin. NOT design, NOT rebuild.**
- **Returning-owner email/password sign-in** — built + verified live this session (SIGNIN step → `signInWithPassword`). Was missing; now works.
- **DataBridge.js** — local-first persistence (localStorage). → **PROMOTED (min slice) 2026-06-26 (ledger #57):** the persistence half is lifted+de-keyed into NEW shared `packages/shared/src/sync/` and the sync-on-reconnect half it never actually finished (write-only queue, no drain — recon #55) is now BUILT there; `DataBridge.js` itself is LEFT IN PLACE as donor-reference (44 Ignition imports — do NOT move/deprecate). First consumer = the walk-and-count loop (LAWNS back-acre dead zones). Full multi-vertical bus + I&A offline-sync still DEFERRED.
- **Tile system** (shared already): `packages/shared/src/components/tiles/`.
- **AIEngine, QR print, OwnerSignup factory, notifications** — in shared (carry vertical-noun leaks; see naming audit).

**Built in CULTIVAR:**
- QR checkout flow (QR→profile→add-ons→capture→cart→confirm→QB invoice) — verified.
- QuickBooks invoicing — real/working (production Intuit approval). *(Ignition has a QB stub, NOT built out.)*
- `business_modules` table (migrated 2026-06-04) — connector/capability model. **Ignition does NOT have this table yet (prerequisite for shared-capability transfer).**
- Working `/login` + PrivateRoute (returning owner can sign in).
- Discovery engine (discovery.builtwithcai.com).

**Designed/specced this session (NOT yet built — post-demo):**
- **Shared Identity & Access capability** — `SPEC-identity-and-access-2026-06-04.md`. Two layers: Identity (Supabase email/pw) + Device-session (per-member PIN on registered device). Includes `member_devices`, bcrypt PINs, both reset flows, owner self-recovery, RBAC (already built in Ignition — promote), Lexicon layer, role-levels.
- Addendum: `ADDENDUM-rbac-and-localsync-2026-06-04.md` (RBAC detail, Lexicon `db_name`-vs-display, role hierarchy, promote-DataBridge).

---

## 5. WHAT'S DECIDED (canonical — don't relitigate, per AC-4)

- **Demo PUSHED** to land the shared Identity & Access capability polished (same call as SM — don't demo smoke).
- **Build shared, once.** Stop copy-to-vertical. Verticals CONSUME `packages/shared`; never reimplement. (RBAC, auth, DataBridge/offline-sync, SM, QB all = "promote from Ignition / build in shared," not copy.)
- **bcrypt migration path:** hash-on-next-successful-login (transparent), force-reset stragglers after a window.
- **Identity-table reconciliation** is the FIRST step of the I&A build: canonical `businesses` (retire/`view` `shops`), canonical `business_members` (retire `shop_members`), recreate `member_devices`+`pin_resets` `business_id`-scoped.
- **Lexicon principle:** system keys off `db_name` ALWAYS; display label is per-business config, NEVER load-bearing.
- **Roles:** People→Roles→Tiles (role implies permissions; don't store per-member arrays). Role levels (jr/sr) are distinct roles w/ bigger tile sets. Lexicon skins role display.
- **`1234` plaintext PIN seen in DB was hand-entered by David debugging** — NOT a code bug. (Verify normal write-path hashes correctly.)
- **Lean Cost + Failure Isolation:** free tiers by default; paid deps must justify or be cut (Blotato: cut). Platform limits (Vercel 12-fn cap) NEVER override failure isolation — cascade is the signal to pay, not to corrupt architecture. Organize api/ by capability, not count. Full principle → PLATFORM_STRATEGY.md § Design Principles.
- **Cost-to-serve must be codified before pricing any AI capability.** Pricing on free-tier cost is a margin trap (founding rates are permanent). Haiku where it suffices, cache system prompts, batch non-real-time. Usage volumes = David's domain truth. Full framework → `docs/strategy/cost-to-serve-framework.md`.

---

## 6. IN FLIGHT / TOP OF MIND (update every session)

- **Immediate priority:** LAWNS Cultivar demo (Leander, TX) — Lauren Bishop is the real buyer; Regina-drove-40-min-on-backroads is the emotional anchor.
- **Just committed (2026-06-04):** `docs/specs/SPEC-identity-and-access-2026-06-04.md`, `docs/audits/live-testing-findings-2026-06-04.md`. AUTH_DEBUG + SM_DEBUG gated false. Ignition blast-radius audit complete (shop_members 16 refs, shops 15, member_devices 10 [missing], pin_resets 3 [missing] — 100% Ignition).
- **Addendum committed:** `docs/specs/SPEC-identity-and-access-addendum-2026-06-04.md` — fold into main spec next session.
- **Next build session (rested, post-demo, maybe w/ Andrew):** Identity & Access — start with identity-table reconciliation per blast-radius map. RBAC = audit Ignition's existing console + promote to shared (verify: roles backed by table vs jsonb? per-business or global?).
- **HIGHEST-LEVERAGE META-TASK:** complete, honest capability inventory of Ignition into built-inventory.md, so "we already built this" is READ, not rediscovered. This is the anti-rebuild + anti-context-loss safeguard.

## 7. WHERE THE DEEP DETAIL LIVES (the reference library — consult, don't paste)

| Need | Doc |
|---|---|
| **The WHY above everything — what TRACE is ultimately for (TOP OF HIERARCHY)** | **`NORTH-STAR.md`** (sits ABOVE MASTER_BRIEF + PLATFORM_STRATEGY — they serve it) |
| Domain truth (size/naming/category/sourcing) — keeps builds domain-correct + the product credible | `docs/domain/README.md` (MAP) + `docs/domain/ontology.md` |
| Working relationship / voice / failure modes | `lightning-david-partnership.md` |
| Session handoff state, infra specifics, active tasks, NON-NEGOTIABLE rules | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Strategy / demo / revenue / philosophy | `MASTER_BRIEF.md` |
| Architecture / where things should live | `PLATFORM_STRATEGY.md` |
| What's actually built in code (ground truth on conflicts) | `PLATFORM_AUDIT.md` |
| Capability inventory | `built-inventory.md` |
| Vertical-noun / naming leaks | `platform-naming-vertical-leak-audit-2026-06-03.md` |
| Onboarding/auth findings | `onboarding-flow-findings-2026-06-03.md` |
| This session's findings | `docs/audits/live-testing-findings-2026-06-04.md` |
| Identity & Access spec (+ addendum) | `docs/specs/SPEC-identity-and-access-2026-06-04.md` |
| Running strategic thinking | `THOUGHTS.md` (tail last ~300 lines) |
| Cost-to-serve + defensible pricing framework | `docs/strategy/cost-to-serve-framework.md` |
| AI Gateway spec (unified routing, cost control, insight capture) | `docs/specs/SPEC-ai-gateway-2026-06-05.md` |

**Conflict rule:** for the *WHY / what we're ultimately for*, `NORTH-STAR.md` is the top of the hierarchy (MASTER_BRIEF + PLATFORM_STRATEGY serve it). For what's *built*, PLATFORM_AUDIT.md wins. For *strategy*, MASTER_BRIEF. For *architecture*, PLATFORM_STRATEGY. For *domain truth*, `docs/domain/`. This bootstrap is the map; those are the territory.

## 7b. LIGHTNING LOAD-MENU (drag these by subject — Lightning can't open repo files)

> Cold-start by subject: name today's subsystem, drag over the .md files in its row. §7 is the *reference library* (what each doc is); this is the *load-by-task index* (what to paste for a given job). All paths verified present at write-time (2026-06-25).
